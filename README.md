# Tail-Recursion-Practice
Practice with tail recursion in Python

This program reads in a list of US States and will return at least one pair of US States that are an anagram for another 
(different) pair of US States.

Written in python to practice working with tail recursion.  Tail recursion saves space without having to increase the depth of the stack.
Program will return each pair of states that are anagrams for eachother along with letters in each pairing in alphabetical order.
